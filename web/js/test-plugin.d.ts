  // This is intended to be a flexible method of instantiating
  // and completion of the initialization of this class. This
  // method must be called before interacting with the
  // WebAssembly object.
  //
  // The first argument to this method is where to get the
  // wasm from. This can be a whole bunch of different types,
  // for example:
  //
  // * A precompiled `WebAssembly.Module`
  // * A typed array buffer containing the wasm bytecode.
  // * A `Promise` of a `Response` which is used with
  //   `instantiateStreaming`
  // * A `Response` itself used with `instantiateStreaming`.
  // * An already instantiated `WebAssembly.Instance`
  //
  // If necessary the module is compiled, and if necessary the
  // module is instantiated. Whether or not it's necessary
  // depends on the type of argument provided to
  // instantiation.
  //
  // If instantiation is performed then the `imports` object
  // passed here is the list of imports used to instantiate
  // the instance. This method may add its own intrinsics to
  // this `imports` object too.
